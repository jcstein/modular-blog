# Modular Blog

This is an implementation of a sovereign rollup built on Celestia to provide data availability and consensus, Ethermint with RollKit for execution, and IPFS for long-term data storage.

This allows users to securely create and share blog posts on their own modular blockchain without the need for a centralized server or authority.

## Contracts

There are example contracts and more details in the [contracts README](./contracts/README.md).

## Building the site

To run the site locally:

```sh
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```
